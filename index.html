<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When talking about 2020, “COVID-19”, a novel coronavirus firstly found in Wuhan, China, in the end of 2019 (Mclntosh, 2020), must be the most popular word that appears on the Internet, newspapers and daily conversations. Since COVID-19 has been discovered and claimed as human pandemic by Chinese government, there are more than 36 millions of people being confirmed with COVID-19 and about 1 million deaths by now (2020). COVID-19 is definitely raising a huge concern of public health around the world.</p>
<p>The COVID 19 data set consisits of 17 variables and 1085 observations.</p>
